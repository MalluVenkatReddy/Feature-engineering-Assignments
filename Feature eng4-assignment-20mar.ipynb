    "#### ### Nominal/OHE Encoding\n",
    "One hot encoding, also known as nominal encoding, is a technique used to represent categorical data as numerical data, which is more suitable for machine learning algorithms. In this technique, each category is represented as a binary vector where each bit corresponds to a unique category. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with three possible values (red, green, blue), we can represent it using one hot encoding as follows:\n",
